Array destructuring

Rules of Hooks
-Only call hooks at the top level
 Dont call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
-Only call hooks from react functions
 called within react functional components and not any regular javascript functional

Updating state based on the previous state, pass a function to a state setter
A state variable can be a string, boolean, object or an , number
Spread Operator ES6

{% comment %} Summary {% endcomment %}

--USESTATE---
-useState hook lets one add state to a functional component--calling it inside a functional component
creates a single piece of state
-In classes, the state is always an object which allows for storing of properties
-useState hook, the state doesnt have to be an object;- can be a number, array, boolean
 - returns an array with two elements, state(current value of the state) and setState(state setter function)

-Incase a new state value depends on a previous state value, a function can be passed to the setter function
  -The setter state accepts the previous state as its argument

-When dealing with objects or arrays, spread the state variable and then call the setter function

component - part of the UI
          - are usable
          -can contain other components
          -placed in a js file
          types
          - functional components
        - class components

          --stateless
          functional components are basically javascript functions-html describes the UI
          can optionally receive an object of properties(props ) return HTML(JSX)



          class component are es6 classes that extend the component class
          must contain a render method
          optionally receive props 
          can maintain a private internal state i.e can contain  a private information


          {% comment %} Named export {% endcomment %}
          component has to be exported with the same name

          Functional components
          -Absence of this keyword
          -Solution without using state
          -without any complicated logic mainly responsible for the UI

          Class components
          -Maintain their own private data
          -Provide life cycle hooks

JSX 
-javascript XML - contains tag name, attributes and children
                - makes code simpler and elegant
                - transpiles to pure js 
                Differences

                -class -> className
                -for -> htmlFor

                -camelCase property naming
                ..onclick -> ..onClick
                ..tabindex -> tabIndex

props - optional input that the component can take
      - allows component to be dynamic
      to specify apps for components they are specified as attributes

      if properties that are going to be passed are known, they can be passed as attributes
      else if its a dynamic content pass it in between the component definition

      properties are mentioned as attributes during the component invocation

      unlike the functional component where props is specified, in class components, the props are 
      available through this.props which is reserved
      props are immutable - their value cannot be changed

state -- managed within the component
         component has full control to change the state
         can be accessed by useState Hook - in functional component
                            this.state - in class components
      -- is an object that is privately maintained inside a component
setState --accepts an object which is a new state of the object

DOs 
  -never modify a state directly instead use setState
  -calls to setState are asynchronous
  callback function is passed to the setState
  whenever a code needs to be executed after the state has been changed, do not place the code after 
  the setState instead place it as a callback function declared as a second parameter
  updating a state based on the previous state, pass a function as an argument instead of an object
  the second parameter to the function is the props .

  setState - the first parameter is an object which sets the state value,
        


        destructuring 
        functional components
        2 ways - destructure in the function itself
              - destructuring in the function body

        class components
        - props are destructured in the render method

        React Events
        - are named using camelCase
        -with JSX pass a function as the event handler rather than a string

        eventHandler is a function and not a function call--do not add the paranthesis

HOC --  Higher Order Component
        A pattern where a function takes a component as an argument and returns a new component

        syntax
        const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(originalComponent)

        when creating HOCs pass down the other props with {...this.props}


Context API
      -provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually
      at every level

      Steps involved in the Context
      1. Create the Context using createContext() make sure to export the provider and consumer
      2. Provide a context::: value at the top component tree include the provider and include the value attribute
      3. Consume the context value:::: use the consumer component and passin a function as its child 


      Note:: 1. a default value can be set to the context, set while creating the context, passed as a parameter in the createContext
                  only used when the component does not have a matching provider in the component tree

                  contextType -- can also Consume the context value used as an alternative to the consumer
                                 Limitations
                                    -Only works with class components
                                    - One can only subscribe to a single context using contextType

Conditional Rendering
      1. if/else
      2. Element variables
      3. Ternary variables
      4. Short circuit Operator
